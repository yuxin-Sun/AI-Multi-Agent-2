Labs for Unity Multi Agent Vehicles—— Multi agent collision avoidance

This repo contains the individual work contribution to the group project.


## Contents 
Lab 3 Problem 1: Agent Models and Path Planning (Assignment leader: Yuxin Sun)
- P 1a: Multi agent collision avoidance in open field (autonomous cars in a city)
- P 1b: Multi agent collision avoidance in intersection (autonomous cars in a city)

In the Unity3d environment, we implement RVO (Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles) algorithm for multi vehicles obstacle avoidance in open fields, and A* planning and priority scheduling method for multi vehicles obstacle avoidance at intersections
